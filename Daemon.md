A daemon is a type of program on Unix-like operating systems that runs unobtrusively in the background, rather than under the direct control of a user, waiting to be activated by the occurance of a specific event or condition.

There are three basic types of processes in Linux: **interactive**, **batch** and **daemon**. Interactive processes are run interactively by a user at the command line (i.e., all-text mode). Batch processes are submitted from a queue of processes and are not associated with the command line; they are well suited for performing recurring tasks when system usage is otherwise low.
